 RELOAD started merely as an english translation of the RBHS theme.  However, as I dove into the project I soon realized that some of the views and options didn't work correctly - or at all in Batocera.  I completely recreated the wheel views, but did keep the grid and gamelist detailed views intact from RBHS.  To be honest, the wheel views alone were A LOT of work as it is just to get the alignment, spacing and rotation angle where it is now.  Of course everything was translated to english including filenames, folders and all source code text.  Lots of tweaks and fixes here and there, too numerous to mention.
